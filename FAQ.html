         Is knowing or learning Mandarin Chinese necessary for working at App-Ark?

<p>No, you are not required to have a background in Mandarin. All important information needed for App-Ark team members are presented in English and the majority of our team is bilingual in Chinese and English. Some consultants have found that knowing the language has been useful for them to converse with students and parents who are not as comfortable speaking in English. However, students are always encouraged to practice using only English with their ECs.</p> 
<p>ECs will also find that while some company messages on WeChat are in Chinese, there is a built-in translation system that can help readers understand at least the gist of the message.</p>
<p>One-on-one Mandarin lessons are paid for by the company but are not mandatory. We do encourage you to learn the language in some way or another as it will be beneficial to your daily living situation when interacting with local people.</p>

       I have heard and read a lot about education agencies in China that “handle” their students’ entire application. Does App-Ark follow this model and/or will I be asked to work write my students’ essays for them?

                        <p>By signing with App-Ark comprehensive consulting package, students will be guided through every step of the application process, from filling out financial international paperwork to scheduling standardize tests to writing college supplements. In this sense, yes, we do handle all parts of their application as many students and parents do not fully understand the complicated nature of the U.S. process.</p>
                        <p>However, you will never be instructed to write or fabricate ideas for students. In fact, doing so is against our standard of procedures because it implies that the EC has not dedicated enough time to communicate and work with his or her students. The purpose of our long-term service is to allow students and consultants a sufficient period to discuss essay topics. When changes are needed, ECs are responsible for providing feedback and comments as well as making small edits directly on their drafts. At times, re-brainstorming with the student may be necessary.</p>

                            <p>It is a three-minute walk from the Nanjing Pedestrian Street and a ten-minute walk from the Bund, a waterfront boardwalk that runs along the western bank of the Huangpu River, with views of the famous Shanghai skyline.

                            <p>Shanghai’s air pollution is often much lower than the air pollution in northern cities like Beijing, though concerns increase during winter when central heating is used. App-Ark is dedicated to providing its employees with a comfortable and safe work environment. Our office is equipped with new high performance Mi Air Purifiers with 360 degree cylindrical filters that removes PM2.5, formaldehyde, and other harmful substances. We also provide all App-Ark staff with masks (Drager X-plore 1190), effective in filtering out PM2.5 for up to eight hours. </p>

                            Company housing is offered to all first-year consultants and a stipend is provided for those who chose to live elsewhere. Some ECs prefer company housing as it provides an environment similar to college residential housing, allowing co-workers to become closer. Furthermore, the conveniences of having your situation set up and rent paid for is something that many incoming ECs appreciate during the transition process. However, others may find the separation between work and personal life difficult or prefer the flexibility of choosing one’s own apartment despite extra costs. Ultimately, this decision depends on your personal preference.
